				<h2>The Legend</h2>

				<p1>According to legends, there was a monstrous creature named Nian (年). Once a year, it would come out of the forest at night and devour entire villages. The steps of protection against Nian during New Year’s Eve transformed into the Spring Festival celebration.

                    Parents would also give children money that night. This way, the children would have something to bribe the monster or other evil spirits with.
                    
                    In another popular story, there is a demon called Sui (祟). On New Year’s Eve, it would come and pat children’s head while sleeping. His touch was tainted. To protect their children, parents would stay up the entire night, guarding them.
                    
                    One couple gave their child a coin to play with. When he fell asleep, they placed the coin next to the pillow. At midnight, an eerie wind snuffed out the candle. When Sui reached for the child, the coin flashed in the darkness and scared him away. The next day, the couple wrapped the coin in red paper to show their neighbors.

				<h3>How to Receive Red Pockets</h3>
                <img src="images/bai.jpg" width="85%" height="1150">
				<p>The red envelope is when you visit in the New Year.Grandparents usually sit at the back of the room.All their children and grandchildren will kowtow.Kowtow (磕头-kē tóu) means to knock on your head (the floor).To do this, kneel down and put your hands on the floor in front of you.Bend down and put your head between your hands.This is the greatest respect for you.Then you can get the red envelope!For children from non-traditional families, there is another way to ask for money.
                    The phrase is: 恭喜发财，红包拿来 (gong xǐ fā cái, hóng bāo ná lái)
                    
                    It means “wishing you wealth and prosperity, hand over the red envelope.” Said with a cheeky grin, it melts hearts and opens up wallets.</p>
